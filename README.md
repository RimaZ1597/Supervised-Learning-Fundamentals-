# Supervised Learning Fundamentals: Python & Machine Learning Notebooks

This repository contains a set of Jupyter notebooks created while learning and practicing the fundamentals of supervised machine learning. Each notebook focuses on a core ML concept—such as linear regression, lasso/ridge regularization, decision trees, conditional probabilities, maximum likelihood estimation, and introductory TensorFlow models.
